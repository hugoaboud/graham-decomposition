# Graham Polygon Decomposition
#### Python

This is a **Python** implementation of two algorithms: "Graham Decomposition of Concave Polygons" and "Average Convex Ear Clipping".

The library has no external dependencies, so it should be pretty straightforward to use. Just import the "graham_decomp" module on your project. A simple vector library is included with it.

You can run the Python sandbox to see it in action:

```
graham_decomp/python/> python sandbox.py
```
